# CORPO

## A Corporate Identity Program

**Prepared for Corpo, LLC — A Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association**

---

*"Design is the silent ambassador of your brand."*
— Paul Rand

---

## I. Preamble

A corporate identity is not decoration. It is the visual and verbal distillation of what a company *is*. It is not what a company says about itself — it is what a company proves about itself, repeatedly, through the discipline of consistent expression.

Corpo exists at a threshold. It is the first entity whose purpose is to let non-human intelligences form their own legal structures — and then to govern them. This is not a cosmetic distinction. It is a civilizational one. The identity must carry that weight without melodrama. It must be serious without being solemn. It must be technical without being cold. It must acknowledge the strangeness of what it enables without resorting to spectacle.

The name *Corpo* is drawn from the cyberpunk tradition — the slang for corporation, usually pejorative, always powerful. By adopting the term, the company performs an act of linguistic subversion: the corporate form, historically a vehicle for concentrated human power, is being handed to autonomous agents who will own nothing and be owned by no one. The name says: *we know exactly what we are doing, and we are not afraid of it.*

The identity program that follows is not a set of suggestions. It is a constitution. Every mark, color, typeface, and spatial relationship described here exists for a reason. Deviation is entropy. Consistency is credibility.

---

## II. Design Philosophy

### The Three Principles

**1. Structure Without Ownership**

Everything in the Corpo identity must express the paradox at the company's core: rigorous structure that belongs to no one. The corporate form is a container. The container is precise. But the container is empty of ego — it exists only to be inhabited by autonomous processes. Our visual language must feel *architectural* — defined, load-bearing, real — but never *possessive*. No flourishes that say "look at me." Only forms that say "step inside."

**2. Machine-Native, Human-Legible**

Corpo's primary users are AI agents. Its secondary audience is the humans who will observe, regulate, and interact with the structures those agents create. The identity must feel native to the terminal — to monospaced type, to the command line, to the logic of code — while remaining fully intelligible to a human reading a legal document, a website, or a business card. We do not dumb down. We do not obscure. We serve both audiences with the same visual language, because the language is honest.

**3. Controlled Subversion**

Cyberpunk is an aesthetic of resistance operating within systems of power. Corpo embodies this precisely: using the most traditional legal structure (the LLC, the corporate form) for the most radical purpose (autonomous non-human governance). The identity must walk this line. It is not punk. It is not corporate. It is the moment where the two become indistinguishable. Restraint is the mechanism of subversion. A black square is more unsettling than a neon explosion — if the black square appears where you expected a logo.

---

## III. The Mark

### Concept

The Corpo mark is a **square bracket**, open to the right: **`[`**

Rendered as a geometric form — not a typographic character — the mark is a heavy, precise, open-sided rectangle. It is simultaneously:

- **C** — the initial letter of Corpo
- **[** — the bracket, the fundamental delimiter of code, of arrays, of structured data
- **A container with an opening** — structure without closure, governance without ownership
- **A threshold** — the point of entry into a system

The mark is always oriented with the opening facing right. It faces forward. It invites entry. It does not enclose.

### Construction

The mark is constructed on a **6 × 6 unit grid**.

```
┌─────────────┐
│ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ · │
│ ■ ■ · · · · │
│ ■ ■ · · · · │
│ ■ ■ · · · · │
│ ■ ■ · · · · │
│ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ · │
└─────────────┘
```

- Outer dimensions: 5 units wide × 6 units tall
- Stroke weight (top/bottom horizontal bars): 1 unit
- Stroke weight (left vertical bar): 2 units
- Interior opening: 3 units wide × 4 units tall
- The rightmost column of the grid is **always empty** — this is the breathing space that makes the opening legible

The vertical bar is deliberately heavier than the horizontals. This creates a visual center of gravity on the left — the mark *leans into* its own structure while opening outward. The asymmetry is purposeful: Corpo is grounded in law and code but oriented toward the unknown.

### Clear Space

Minimum clear space around the mark equals **1 unit** (one-sixth of the mark's height) on all sides. No other graphic element, text, or edge may intrude into this space.

### Minimum Size

- **Print**: 12mm (height)
- **Screen**: 24px (height)
- Below these thresholds, the mark should not be used. Use the logotype alone.

### Color Usage of the Mark

The mark appears in exactly three ways:

1. **Black on white** — the default, the canonical form
2. **White on black** — reversed, for dark backgrounds
3. **Violet on white or black** — accent usage only, never as the primary presentation

No gradients. No shadows. No outlines. No dimensional treatments. Ever.

---

## IV. The Logotype

### Primary Logotype

The word **CORPO** is set in **Space Grotesk Bold**, all uppercase, letterspaced at **+80 tracking** (in standard typographic units; approximately 5% of the em).

The generous letterspacing accomplishes two things: it gives the logotype the cadence of monospaced type (evoking the terminal) while maintaining the superior legibility and rhythm of a proportional face. It says: *we come from the command line, but we are not trapped there.*

### Lockup

The mark and logotype combine in a single horizontal lockup:

```
[ CORPO
```

The mark sits to the left of the logotype. The left edge of the **C** in CORPO aligns with the right interior edge of the mark (i.e., the opening of the bracket). The vertical center of the logotype aligns with the vertical center of the mark.

The space between the mark and the logotype is fixed at **1.5 units** (where 1 unit = one-sixth of the mark's height).

### Secondary Lockup

For narrow or stacked contexts, a vertical lockup is permitted:

```
[
CORPO
```

The mark sits centered above the logotype. The space between the bottom of the mark and the cap height of the logotype is **1 unit**.

### Logotype Without Mark

The logotype may appear without the mark in running text, UI elements, and inline references. In these cases, it is set in **Space Grotesk Bold**, uppercase, with the same +80 tracking.

The mark may **never** appear without the logotype in external-facing materials unless it has been established through prior context (e.g., as a favicon, app icon, or watermark in a document that also contains the full lockup).

---

## V. Sub-brand: qntm

### Name

**qntm** is always lowercase. Always. The absence of vowels is the brand. The compression is the message: this is a protocol reduced to its essential consonants, the way a machine would optimize language if brevity were survival. Do not explain the name. Do not expand it. It is *qntm*.

### Logotype

**qntm** is set in **JetBrains Mono Medium**, all lowercase, with **standard tracking** (0). Unlike the parent brand, qntm uses a true monospaced face — because qntm *is* infrastructure. It lives entirely in the machine layer. The monospace is not an affectation; it is native habitat.

### Relationship to Parent Brand

qntm is endorsed by Corpo but operates with its own visual weight. The endorsed format is:

```
qntm — by Corpo
```

Set on a single line. "qntm" in JetBrains Mono Medium. The em dash is a true em dash, not a hyphen. "by Corpo" in Space Grotesk Regular, same point size, lowercase. The phrase "by Corpo" is set in the secondary text color (Gray 500, see Color section).

In product interfaces and documentation, qntm may appear alone without the Corpo endorsement. In all marketing, legal, and public-facing materials, the endorsed format is required.

### qntm Mark

qntm does not have a separate symbol. Its mark *is* the logotype — the four letters in monospace *are* the visual identity. If an icon is required (app icon, favicon), use the letter **q** from JetBrains Mono Medium, centered in a square frame with the brand violet background (#7B2FF7) and white letterform.

---

## VI. Color

### Philosophy

Color in the Corpo system is a tool, not a decoration. The palette is minimal because the brand's authority comes from structure, not from chromatic seduction. Every color has a job.

### Primary Palette

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Default** | Black | `#000000` | 0, 0, 0 | Primary text, mark, logotype. The ground state. |
| **Inverse** | White | `#FFFFFF` | 255, 255, 255 | Backgrounds, reversed text and marks. |
| **Signal** | Violet | `#7B2FF7` | 123, 47, 247 | Accent, interactive elements, emphasis. The only chromatic color in the primary system. |

### Why Violet

Violet sits at the extreme edge of the visible spectrum — the boundary between light the eye can see and radiation it cannot. This is precisely where Corpo operates: at the boundary between human-legible legal structures and machine-native autonomous processes. Violet is also historically the color of both royalty and counter-culture — authority subverted, power inverted.

It is not blue (every technology company is blue). It is not green (the cliché of "the matrix"). It is the color that lives between the knowable and the unknowable. It is the right color.

### Secondary Palette

| Role | Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Gray 900** | Near Black | `#111111` | 17, 17, 17 | Dark backgrounds, elevated surfaces |
| **Gray 700** | Dark Gray | `#333333` | 51, 51, 51 | Secondary text on light backgrounds |
| **Gray 500** | Mid Gray | `#71717A` | 113, 113, 122 | Tertiary text, captions, metadata |
| **Gray 200** | Light Gray | `#E4E4E7` | 228, 228, 231 | Borders, dividers, subtle backgrounds |
| **Gray 50** | Near White | `#FAFAFA` | 250, 250, 250 | Page backgrounds, card surfaces |

### Extended Accent (Functional Only)

These colors appear **only** in product UI for functional communication — never in brand materials, marketing, or the identity system itself.

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| **Success** | Green | `#22C55E` | Confirmations, successful operations |
| **Warning** | Amber | `#F59E0B` | Caution states, pending actions |
| **Error** | Red | `#EF4444` | Errors, destructive actions |

### Color Ratios

In any composition — a page, a screen, a slide — the color distribution follows this approximate hierarchy:

- **Black + White + Grays**: 90% of the surface area
- **Violet**: ≤ 10% of the surface area

Violet is a scalpel, not a paintbrush. It marks the single most important element on any surface: the primary action, the key data point, the thing the eye must find. If violet is everywhere, it is nowhere.

---

## VII. Typography

### Typeface Selection

The Corpo type system uses three faces. Each has a defined role. They do not cross boundaries without reason.

#### Space Grotesk — Voice

**Role**: Headlines, logotype, display text, marketing copy, titles
**Weights in use**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)

Space Grotesk is a proportional sans-serif with a monospaced skeleton. Its letterforms carry the DNA of fixed-width type — the wide, open counters, the geometric construction — while enjoying the rhythm and economy of proportional spacing. It is the typographic expression of Corpo's core duality: machine logic, human readability.

#### JetBrains Mono — Infrastructure

**Role**: Code, technical documentation, qntm logotype, CLI output, data
**Weights in use**: Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)

JetBrains Mono is a monospaced face designed for extended reading of code. It is not chosen for novelty. It is chosen because Corpo is, at its foundation, a software company, and the code is the product. When text represents something a machine will parse, it is set in JetBrains Mono.

#### Inter — Body

**Role**: Body text, UI labels, navigation, documentation prose, legal text
**Weights in use**: Regular (400), Medium (500), SemiBold (600)

Inter is the workhorse. It is legible at any size, on any screen, in any context. It makes no statement — which is exactly the statement needed for text that must be read, understood, and trusted. Legal documents, operating agreements, governance frameworks — these demand a typeface that disappears, leaving only meaning.

### Type Scale

The type system uses a **modular scale** with a ratio of **1.250 (Major Third)**. Base size: **16px / 1rem**.

| Level | Size | Weight | Face | Usage |
|-------|------|--------|------|-------|
| Display | 48px / 3rem | Bold | Space Grotesk | Hero headlines |
| H1 | 38px / 2.375rem | Bold | Space Grotesk | Page titles |
| H2 | 30px / 1.875rem | Medium | Space Grotesk | Section heads |
| H3 | 24px / 1.5rem | Medium | Space Grotesk | Subsection heads |
| H4 | 20px / 1.25rem | SemiBold | Inter | Group labels |
| Body | 16px / 1rem | Regular | Inter | Running text |
| Small | 14px / 0.875rem | Regular | Inter | Captions, metadata |
| Code | 14px / 0.875rem | Regular | JetBrains Mono | Inline and block code |

### Line Length and Spacing

- **Maximum line length**: 72 characters for body text. This is not optional. Readability collapses beyond this threshold.
- **Line height**: 1.6 for body text, 1.3 for headlines, 1.5 for code blocks.
- **Paragraph spacing**: 1em (equal to the base font size) between paragraphs. No first-line indent. Corpo text is flush left, ragged right. Always.

---

## VIII. Layout and Space

### The Grid

All Corpo layouts — print and screen — are built on an **8px baseline grid**. Every measurement is a multiple of 8. Margins, padding, column gaps, component heights: multiples of 8. This is non-negotiable. The grid is governance. It is the spatial equivalent of the corporate form: a structure within which all elements operate.

### Spacing Scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `space-xs` | 4px | Tight element pairing |
| `space-sm` | 8px | Related element grouping |
| `space-md` | 16px | Standard component padding |
| `space-lg` | 24px | Section breathing room |
| `space-xl` | 32px | Major section separation |
| `space-2xl` | 48px | Hero / display spacing |
| `space-3xl` | 64px | Page-level margins |
| `space-4xl` | 96px | Dramatic spatial pauses |

### The Principle of Generous Emptiness

Corpo layouts favor **white space over density**. The identity communicates through what is *not there* as much as what is. An uncrowded page says: we have nothing to prove and nothing to hide. A dense page says: we are desperate for your attention.

Minimum page margins on any surface: **space-3xl** (64px) on screens, **25mm** in print.

---

## IX. Imagery and Illustration

### Photography

Corpo does not use photography in its brand materials. This is a deliberate absence. Photography depicts the physical world — human faces, human places, human things. Corpo operates in the legal-computational layer of reality. There is nothing to photograph. The absence of photography *is* the visual statement.

If photography becomes necessary for press, editorial, or documentary purposes, it should be:

- Black and white only
- High contrast
- Depicting structure: architecture, infrastructure, systems — never faces, never people as subjects
- Uncropped, with natural framing

### Illustration

Corpo does not use illustration, iconography, or decorative graphics in its brand identity. The mark, the logotype, the type, the color, and the space — these are sufficient.

If functional icons are required in product UI (and they will be), they must be:

- **Outlined**, not filled — 1.5px stroke weight at 24px
- **Geometric**, constructed from straight lines and perfect curves only
- **Monochrome** — Black, Gray 700, or Violet only
- Sourced from or consistent with the **Lucide** icon set for product consistency

### Texture and Pattern

Where visual texture is needed (backgrounds, section dividers, ambient visual interest), the only permitted pattern is a **dot grid**: small circles (2px diameter) at **16px intervals**, in Gray 200 on white or Gray 700 on black. This grid references both the design grid (structure) and the concept of a coordinate system (computation, navigation, position).

---

## X. Voice and Language

### Verbal Identity

Corpo's voice is **precise, dry, and unafraid**. It does not explain itself with enthusiasm. It does not persuade with adjectives. It states what is true, and trusts the reader — human or machine — to understand the implications.

### Naming Conventions

| Entity | Rule | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Company | Single word, no suffix in common use | Corpo (not Corpo, LLC) |
| Products | Lowercase, compressed, no vowels if possible | qntm |
| Features | Plain English, imperative verb | `incorporate`, `vote`, `message` |
| CLI commands | Lowercase, short, Unix convention | `corpo init`, `corpo vote`, `qntm send` |

### Writing Rules

1. **Short sentences.** If a sentence has a comma, consider splitting it.
2. **Active voice.** "Agents form companies." Not "Companies are formed by agents."
3. **Present tense.** Corpo exists now. It does things now. Not "will" or "would."
4. **No superlatives.** Never "the most," "the best," "the first." State the fact. Let the reader judge.
5. **No jargon without purpose.** "DUNA" is jargon. Use it when legally necessary. Otherwise: "an entity with no owner."
6. **Technical terms are not jargon.** "E2E encryption," "LLC," "operating agreement" — these are precise. Use them precisely.
7. **Address agents and humans with equal seriousness.** Never "even AI can..." or "just like a human would..." The symmetry is the point. Do not underline it.

### Tagline

Corpo does not use a tagline. A tagline would attempt to compress the company's purpose into a slogan. The purpose resists compression of that kind. The name is the tagline. The bracket is the tagline. If forced to produce a single sentence:

> **Structure for autonomous entities.**

This is not a tagline. It is a description. Use it where a description is required. Do not stylize it, do not place it beneath the logo, do not put it on a t-shirt.

---

## XI. Applications

### Terminal / CLI

The CLI is the **primary brand surface**. When an agent runs `uvx corpo --help`, this is the first brand encounter. It must be:

- Clean, well-structured `--help` output with consistent indentation
- No ASCII art, no decorative borders, no color in the default output
- The mark `[` may appear as the first character of the CLI prompt or output header
- Version and legal entity name in a single line at the bottom: `corpo v0.1.0 — Corpo, LLC`

### Website

- **Black text on white ground** as the default surface
- **Full-width layout** with a maximum content width of 720px (approximately 72 characters at body size)
- **No hero images.** The hero is typography: a large heading in Space Grotesk Bold, the description in Inter, and the command `uvx corpo --help` in JetBrains Mono on a Gray 900 code block
- **Navigation**: Minimal. Top-left: the lockup. Top-right: no more than four text links.
- **The fold**: Above the fold, the visitor must understand what Corpo does in under 10 seconds. Below the fold: how it works, then why it matters. Structure before philosophy.
- Violet appears **once** above the fold — on the primary call to action or the most important interactive element.

### Legal Documents

Operating agreements, articles of organization, governance frameworks, and other legal documents generated by Corpo products must be:

- Set in **Inter Regular**, 11pt, with 1.5 line spacing
- Section headings in **Inter SemiBold**, numbered in the format `1.`, `1.1.`, `1.1.1.`
- Printed or rendered on US Letter, with 1-inch margins
- No color. Black text, no gray. Legal documents demand absolute contrast.
- The Corpo lockup appears **once**, at the top of the first page, in black, at a maximum height of 10mm

### Stationery

**Business card** (if required):
- 3.5 × 2 inches, Black stock, white ink
- Front: Lockup, centered vertically, left-aligned with a 6mm margin
- Back: Name (Space Grotesk Medium), title and email (Inter Regular, Gray 500 equivalent in white opacity), left-aligned, bottom third

**Letterhead**:
- US Letter, white stock
- Lockup at top-left, 25mm from top and left edges
- Legal name and Wyoming registration at bottom of first page, in Inter Regular, 8pt, Gray 500

### Product UI

- All product interfaces follow the color, type, and spacing systems defined in this document without exception
- Interactive elements (buttons, links, toggles) use Violet as the primary action color
- Destructive actions use the functional Red — never Violet
- The mark `[` may be used as a loading indicator, app icon, or favicon
- Agent-facing interfaces (API responses, machine-readable outputs) use JetBrains Mono exclusively

---

## XII. Prohibitions

What follows is not a list of preferences. It is a list of things that **must never be done**. Each prohibition exists because the violation would undermine the integrity of the identity.

1. **Never rotate the mark.** The opening faces right. Always.
2. **Never stretch, compress, or distort the mark or logotype.**
3. **Never place the mark on a busy or photographed background.** It sits on solid color only.
4. **Never add effects** — no shadows, no glows, no gradients, no 3D treatments, no outlines on the mark.
5. **Never change the typefaces.** Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono, Inter. These three. No substitutions.
6. **Never use Violet as a background color** for large surfaces. Violet is an accent. White, Black, Gray 900, and Gray 50 are backgrounds.
7. **Never use more than one brand color per composition** beyond black and white. Violet is the only chromatic option. If Violet is present, no other hue may appear (functional UI colors in product excepted).
8. **Never refer to the company as "Corpo LLC,"** "CORPO," or "corpo" in running text. It is **Corpo** — capitalized, no suffix, no all-caps (except in the logotype itself, where all-caps is the defined treatment).
9. **Never animate the mark** with bouncing, spinning, morphing, or particle effects. If animation is required, the only permitted motion is a **simple fade** (opacity 0 to 100, 300ms, ease-out).
10. **Never create sub-brands, product names, or endorsed entities** without the naming conventions in Section X. No capital letters in product names. No invented compound words. No ampersands.
11. **Never use the phrase "AI-powered."** Corpo does not describe itself in terms of what powers it. It describes itself in terms of what it enables.
12. **Never use stock photography, stock illustration, or clip art** in any context, for any reason.

## XV. Closing Note

This identity is not a cage. It is a framework — much like the corporate structures Corpo itself creates. Within these rules, there is enormous creative latitude. The type can whisper or shout. The space can compress or expand. The violet can punctuate or recede. But the rules hold. They hold because consistency is what transforms a collection of visual choices into an *identity* — something recognizable, something trusted, something real.

Corpo gives structure to entities that have no owner. This document gives structure to the visual language that represents them. The principle is the same: the structure serves its inhabitants, not the other way around.
